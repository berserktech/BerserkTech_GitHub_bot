# BerserkTech_GitHub_bot
Telegram Bot for our repository

## Why?

This started as a go practice by
[@sadasant](https://github.com/sadasant), but now it is the official
Telegram bot for BerserkTech.

It doesn't do much, it listens to github events and sends them over
Telegram.


## Events

This bot is currently listening to the following events:


```
commit_comment
issue_comment
pull_request_review_comment
pull_request_review
pull_request
issues
status
ping
```

Plase make sure to check the unit tests we have so far.

## TODOs

- Move it to the BerserkTech organization in Zeit.
- Improve this readme.
- Write better integration tests.
- Get feedback.
